# industry
A plugin of great industry that allows you to get a response like the WordPress REST API does or Genesis would from any URL.

BTW That works, <em>but</em> a URL that doesn't generate posts, is going to probably break this shit hard. Leave me alone, I wrote this in like an hour.

But, it's a working proof-of-concept for making Genesis live update the loop, without a page refresh, which is cool.
